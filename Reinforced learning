## Improved Design Document: Reinforcement Learning for Optimal Parameter Selection in System Simulator

This improved design document incorporates suggestions for clarity and addresses potential issues:

**1. Introduction**

Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a powerful method for identifying optimal configurations in complex systems, including system simulators. This document details an RL framework designed to optimize the following parameters: BUFFER_SIZE, MESH_SIZE_X, MESH_SIZE_Y, MIN_LATENCY, MAX_BANDWIDTH, and THROTTLING_PERCENTAGE. It outlines the states, actions, reward structure, and proposes a suitable RL algorithm for this application.

**2. RL Framework**

**2.1. States/Observations:**

- The current state, also referred to as observation, represents the system's condition based on measurable metrics. These include:
    - Buffer occupancy
    - Read and write transaction latency
    - Bandwidth utilization
    - Power consumption
    - Arbitration rates
    - Historical performance data (e.g., moving averages)

**2.2. Actions:**

- Actions signify adjustments made to system parameters. These include:
    - Changing BUFFER_SIZE
    - Modifying MESH_SIZE_X and MESH_SIZE_Y
    - Tuning MIN_LATENCY and MAX_BANDWIDTH
    - Setting THROTTLING_PERCENTAGE

**2.3. Rewards:**

- Rewards are the feedback mechanism guiding the RL agent towards optimal policies. They are calculated based on desired performance metrics:
    - **Positive rewards:**
        - Minimizing read and write latency
        - Maximizing bandwidth utilization
        - Minimizing power consumption
    - **Negative rewards:**
        - Buffer occupancy exceeding a threshold
        - Excessive arbitration rates (indicating contention)

**3. Recommended RL Algorithm: Deep Q-Network (DQN)**

**Justification:**

- DQN excels in problems with large state spaces, a common characteristic of system simulators due to the interplay of numerous parameters.
- It effectively handles continuous state spaces through function approximation using neural networks.
- DQN's experience replay mechanism promotes sample efficiency and training stability.
- The simulator's trace data can be used for experience replay, enriching the learning process.
- The simulator's discrete time steps align well with DQN's discrete action selection.

**4. Training Process**

**4.1. Initialization:**

- Initialize the DQN agent with random or pre-defined parameter values.

**4.2. Experience Gathering:**

- Execute episodes where the agent interacts with the simulator, observing states, taking actions, and receiving rewards.
- Store these experiences (state-action-reward-next state transitions) in a replay buffer.

**4.3. Training:**

- Sample experience batches from the replay buffer and update the DQN's Q-network parameters to minimize the temporal difference (TD) error.
- Utilize target network updates and epsilon-greedy exploration to balance exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (leveraging learned optimal actions).

**4.4. Evaluation:**

- Periodically evaluate the learned policies on a validation set to assess performance and ensure the ability to generalize to unseen scenarios.

**5. Hyperparameter Tuning**

- Fine-tune hyperparameters like learning rate, discount factor, batch size, and neural network architecture to optimize DQN's performance. Techniques like grid search or Bayesian optimization can be employed.






Deep Q-Networks (DQN)  is well-suited for handling complex decision spaces and can learn to navigate through large state-action spaces efficiently.DQN has been widely studied and implemented in various domains, including robotics, gaming, and network optimization. Its well-established framework and availability of libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) make it relatively easy to implement and experiment with.
The limitations of DQN are Generating representative training data for NoC designs, especially for diverse network topologies and traffic patterns, can be challenging and may require extensive simulations or real-world measurements.Finding the right set of hyperparameters for a given NoC design problem can require extensive experimentation and computational resources.
